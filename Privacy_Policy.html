<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Movie Hub App does not collect, store, or share any personal information from users.</strong></p>
<p>This application is designed to provide movie details, trailers (via YouTube links), and public data via APIs such as The Movie Database (TMDb). It does not require any form of login or user account.</p>
